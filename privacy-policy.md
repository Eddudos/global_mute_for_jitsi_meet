- No data is sent to any server.
- The extension runs entirely in your browser.
- It only interacts with open tabs that match the domain `https://meet.jit.si/*`.
- Its sole purpose is to allow you to mute/unmute your microphone on Google Meet using keyboard shortcuts.

We do **not**:

This policy will be updated if data collection is ever introduced (which we currently have no plans to do).
